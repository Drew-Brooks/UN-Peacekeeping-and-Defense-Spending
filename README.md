# UN-Peacekeeping-and-Defense-Spending

Project by Drew Brooks for the University of Missouri Master of Science in Data Science and Analytics

Initial data from the United Nations: https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/data-troop-and-police-contributions
the International Peacekeeping Institute (IPI) Providing for Peacekeeping project: http://www.providingforpeacekeeping.org/contributions/
and the World Bank: https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS?downloadformat=csv

Notebooks in order:
1. UN DPKO Data Exploration -- exploratory data analysis and data carpentry
2. Capstone Regressions -- linear regressions to answer the question "does defense spending influence contributions to UN peacekeeping operations?" (spoiler alert: no)
3. Capstone Clustering -- attempts to use K-Means clustering and LDA classification to predict Troop contributions based on the contributor characteristics identified by the IPI, as well as defense spending as percent of Gross Domestic Product, as reported by the World Bank. 
4. Capstone Dash Work -- light data carpentry and tinkering to make the dashboard work
